# Toika Web Server

Software that allows you to control a Toika dobby loom from any modern web browser, e.g. on a phone or tablet.

For more information, read the [main documentation](https://r-owen.github.io/base_loom_server/).

You must decide whether the control direction (weave/unweave) using the REVERSE button on the dobby head or the direction button in the browser display.
Read more about this at [Weave Direction](https://r-owen.github.io/base_loom_server/weaving/#weave-direction).
Make your choice in the Settings panel.
