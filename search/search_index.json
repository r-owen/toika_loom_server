You have two choices, Software controls the weave direction. To change direction, press the square button that shows the weave direction (a green or red arrow) on the web display. The physical button on the dobby head is ignored . The loom controls the weave direction. You have to press the physical button on the dobby head to change direction. The square button showing weave direction is only a display (you can't click it). If your web display device (i.e. phone or tablet) is mounted where you can easily reach it, then I recommend software control of direction, because the direction display will always be correct. If your web display device is not in a convenient location, then have the loom control direction. Unfortunately, in this mode the displayed direction will sometimes be wrong. This is because the loom does not report anything when you press the direction button. The software can't see that anything has changed until the next time the loom asks for a pick (i.e. when you press the pedal). To have the loom control weaving direction, start the loom server with extra command-line argument --direction-control loom . To have software control weaving direction, omit this, or specify --direction-control software . The Software toka_loom_sever is served at PyPI .
