# Web server that controls a Toika dobby loom

This server is intended to allow you to control your loom from any phone, tablet or other device that has wifi and a web browser.

This server must run on a computer that is connected (via a USB cable) to your loom.
This code has only been tested on macOS but should also work on any flavor of linux.

Warning: at present this software ignores the reverse button on the loom;
to change directions you must push the direction arrow on the web display.
This means you should probably run your web browser on a phone or tablet mounted somewhere very convenient,
such as to the front of the castle.

A future update will allow you to choose whether to use the software or the loom (but not both,
because the dobby head does not allow that).
