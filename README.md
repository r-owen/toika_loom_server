# Web server that controls a Toika dobby loom

This server is intended to allow you to control your loom from any phone, tablet or other device that has wifi and a web browser.

For for usage and installation instructions please see the [documentation](https://r-owen.github.io/toika_loom_server/).

**Warning**: this software has not yet been tested on a real loom, but I have a loom on order.
The documentation supplied by Toika was clear, but I may have missed something.
Meanwhile, trying it cannot hurt your loom, the only risk is that it will do nothing or raise the wrong shafts.
Initially I suggest running the server with command-line option `-v` (verbose) so you have more information for filing a ticket at [github](https://github.com/r-owen/toika_loom_server/issues).
